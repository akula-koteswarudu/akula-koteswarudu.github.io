# My Summer at Gojek: Learning Front-End Development

*A focused internship experience in React, TypeScript, and design systems*

---

## The Opportunity

During the summer after my third year of Computer Science Engineering at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad, I interned at Gojek, one of Southeast Asia's leading technology companies. I was responsible for contributing to Apsara, their design system that powered user interfaces for the data engineering team's applications.

This was my first professional software development experience, giving me the chance to learn front-end development and understand how modern web applications are built.

## What I Worked On

My main focus was developing and optimizing reusable React.js components with TypeScript for the Apsara design system. The goal was to ensure consistency across the data engineering team's various applications and tools.

**Key Activities:**
- **Developed React components** using TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability
- **Optimized existing UI components** using the Redix library to improve performance and simplicity
- **Rewrote components** with better performance characteristics and simpler APIs
- **Tested and documented** component changes for other developers
- **Ensured backward compatibility** to minimize disruption

## Technical Skills Gained

This internship gave me hands-on experience with:

- **React.js** - Component-based architecture and modern patterns
- **TypeScript** - Static typing, interfaces, and type safety
- **Redix Library** - Building primitive, composable UI components
- **Design Systems** - Principles of consistent, reusable UI development
- **Performance Optimization** - Bundle size reduction and render performance
- **Component Testing** - Ensuring reliability across different use cases

## Key Learnings

Working on a design system taught me valuable lessons about:

- **Component Reusability** - Building components that work across different contexts
- **Developer Experience** - Creating components that are easy to understand and use
- **Documentation** - Writing clear examples and usage guidelines
- **Composition over Inheritance** - Building complex interfaces from simple, focused components

## Impact

This internship provided me with a solid foundation in front-end development and introduced me to professional software development. The experience gave me valuable exposure to modern web technologies and development practices.

The experience taught me to think about software as a product that provides value to both end users and the developers who maintain it.
